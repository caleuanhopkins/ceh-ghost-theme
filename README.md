# CEH - A Ghost Theme

CEH is a theme create by Callum Euan Hopkins (@caleuanhopkins) and was created for personal purposes only. All are welcomed to use.

This theme requires the CEH custom build of Ghost to run fully. You can grab that custom version of Ghost here:

## Required

### Version 1.0

Version 1.0 currently requires the custom build of Ghost by Callum Hopkins which includes custom server files for Ghost to handle Post Imagery and global variables for social media tags located in the theme's head. Without these extra core files, the theme will continue to function however may not function to it's full potential. Grab it here: [https://github.com/caleuanhopkins/ghost-ceh-release/tree/master](https://github.com/caleuanhopkins/ghost-ceh-release/tree/master)

Be **WARNED**! It is in no way supported by the Ghost foundation so use it at your own risk!
